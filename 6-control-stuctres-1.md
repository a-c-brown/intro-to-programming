# Control Structures Part 1

Computer programs need the ability to perform different actions in different contexts. One way to accomplish this is through the use of control structures. 

A _control structure_ is a means to guide the execution of a program through a variety of outcomes given some input.

Consider the following statements:

1. If it is raining, wear a raincoat.
2. It is raining.
3. Wear a raincoat.

The above is a perfectly commonplace argument<sup>1</sup> in the English language, but it is also easily represented in computer programming languages.

```
is_raining = true

if is_raining:
    print("Wear a raincoat")
```

Common control structures include:
1. if
2. else if
3. else
4. [loops](7-control-structures-2.md)
