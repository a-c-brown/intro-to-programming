# Basic Concepts in Computer Science

Two of the most fundamental concepts in computer science are:

1. Memory
2. Variables
   
## Memory

*Memory* is a mechanism for storing information<sup>1</sup>. In contemporary, digital, programmable computers, memory is either:

1. Volatile
2. Non-volatile (NV)

*Volatile* memory only stores information while it has power supplied to it. *Non-volatile* memory may store information with or without power.

In this course, the files we work with can be saved to non-volatile memory so that the information they contain can be retrieved even if the media on which they are stored loses power. 

When the information in these files is read by a program, that information is stored in volatile memory. It will be lost when its storage media loses power, or instructions are given to remove it from that media.

## Variables

A *variable* is a named location for memory in a computer. Variables may be:

1. Declared<sup>2</sup>
2. Assigned
3. Initialized<sup>3</sup>

When we *declare* a variable we define an identifier by which we may refer to data in memory. *Assignment* refers to binding data to that identifier. 

Below, __my_variable_identifier__ is simply an arbitrary name we use to refer to the datum __7__ stored somewhere in the computers volatile memory.

```my_variable_identifier = 7```
